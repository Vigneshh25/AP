/*
*
* The Template Method Pattern describes the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring
* some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm
* without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure.
*
* We can use the Template Method pattern in situations when there is an algorithm, some steps of
* which could be implemented in multiple different ways. In such scenarios, the Template Method
* pattern suggests keeping the outline of the algorithm in a separate method referred to as a
* template method inside a class.
